  ## 3. Proc means
     c. Reports statistics for continuous characteristics (i.e., mean, std, median, p25, p75)
  ## 4. Proc logistic
     d. Reports the odds ratio predicting a binary outcome among groups of interest
        -The "Logistic Regression Model Statistics.png" and "Logistic Regression odds ratio and p-values.png"
